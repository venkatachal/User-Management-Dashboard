# User-Management-Dashboard
A User Management Dashboard using AngularJS enables CRUD operations on JSONPlaceholder. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data. AngularJS manages the UI and data binding with the `$http` service to interact with the API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`) for real-time updates.
